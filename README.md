# phase-1-project
The project title is Mnemo
It is basically a journal app with a to do list.

- A user is supposed to log in in order to gain access to the app.
After the log in the user is directed to the main page whereby he can add the tasks he wants to do and comment about them in the text area as now a journal.

- To add a new task click on the New task input area and submit it using the orange button written add.

- After adding a task you cross it by clicking on it when you are done with it and delete it if you wish using the x black button at the right side of the task.

- For demonstration purposes use the username as {Stance} and the password as {stance123}.

- There's also a registration page but I'm yet to add more responsiveness to it.

- I'm looking forward to intergrate more features like alarm, reminders and calender as I advance in JavaScript.
